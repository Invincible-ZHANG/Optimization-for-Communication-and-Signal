## Additional Tools
### CVX
CVX is a MATLAB-based software for solving convex optimization problems. It provides a high-level interface for specifying convex optimization problems and calls appropriate solvers like SDPT3 or SeDuMi. Before running scripts that require CVX, ensure it is installed and set up properly in your MATLAB environment. Installation instructions can be found at the [CVX homepage](http://cvxr.com/cvx).

### Toolboxes
Ensure that the Optimization Toolbox and Signal Processing Toolbox are installed, as some scripts may utilize functions from these toolboxes.

## Usage

To run the scripts, ensure you have MATLAB installed on your computer. Open MATLAB, navigate to the directory containing the scripts, and run each script by typing its filename in the MATLAB command window. For scripts utilizing CVX, ensure that the CVX framework is initiated with the command `cvx_setup`.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB (version R2020a or newer recommended)
- Basic knowledge of MATLAB programming
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- CVX for MATLAB
